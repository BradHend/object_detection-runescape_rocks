# object_detection-runescape_rocks
Learning about [TensorFlow's Object Detection API](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection) using Runescape as an event generator


# Motivation: 
The MMORPG Old-School Runescape was selected for the basis of experimentation as it provides a low-clutter, highly repeatable, envrionment containing a diverse set of objects that can be used to generate traceable training datasets and perform real-time Model test & evaluation.
